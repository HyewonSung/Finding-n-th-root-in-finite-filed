# Finding-n-th-root-in-finite-filed

In this repository, I put several finding n-th root algorithms in finite field.
To check the time complexity of each algorithms, I use prime p which has 100 bit size, and n=625.
At the end of every algorithm, there is a cpu time checking code, so you can check and compare with other algorithms.
(Making p as 100 bit prime, I use Miller-Rabin primality test which was already stored in Python function.)
